# loom-vs-coroutines

Comparison between Project Loom and Kotlin Coroutines


## Goals

Have a look on 

- Parellism
- Structured Concurrency
- ThreadLocal like Context
- Integrate with existing framework (webframework/io)
- Cancellation of process trees
- Andere implementaties (Fibers)
- Reactive Streams (Flow, Channel)

## Notes on running the project in Intellij

* open loom or coroutines separately (not in one project)
* use java 1.8 for Kotlin/coroutines
* Set up loom as follows:
